## INTRO

I analyzed the entire dataset from the "Flight Delay Dataset - 2024" , which is available on Kaggle.com.
Once importing the file into Tableau Public, I noticed it contained 35 columns and over 7 million rows(screenshot reference below).

Due to the large size of this dataset, I decided to use Tableau to analyze and visualize my objectives.
I also wanted to use Tableau to practice my visualization skills and become more familiar with this tool.

## OBJECTIVES

Based on the data provided, I wanted to explore some questions which interested me:
1. Which flight routes have the longest delays?
2. Are there more delays during certain parts of the year?
3. Which states have the longest delays?
